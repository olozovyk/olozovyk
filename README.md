### Hi and Welcome ðŸ‘‹ </br>
I am Oleh, diving into the world of web development. I am positioning myself as a backend developer but also have frontend skills.

Glad to share my projects here!

 
#### [User Management](https://github.com/olozovyk/user-management) - NestJS, REST API, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
  
A REST API service handles user management, authentication and authorization (with roles). It was created using NestJS. PostgreSQL is used for a data storage through TypeORM. Interaction with AWS S3 for storing user avatars has been implemented. The service also includes the [Swagger](https://ec2-52-58-90-89.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/um/api/docs) documentation and unit tests, as well as end-to-end tests. </br></br>

#### [Subscription Weather Bot](https://github.com/olozovyk/subscription-weather-bot) - NestJS, Telegraf, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
    
A Telegram bot gives users an opportunity to create weather forecast subscriptions. It interacts with external APIs to provide up-to-date weather information. The bot was developed using NestJS, with a data storage managed by PostgreSQL through TypeORM. Task scheduling is implemented using a built-in feature of NestJS. </br></br>

#### [Countries](https://github.com/olozovyk/react-countries) - SPA, React, Typescript, Redux, RTK Query, Emotion
  
A single-page application built with React using TypeScript. The app fetches country information from an external API and displays essential details about each country. Redux is used to handle the state, and RTK Query is used for data fetching. [Link](https://rest-countries-ol.netlify.app/)
