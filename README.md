### Hi and Welcome ðŸ‘‹ </br>
I am Oleh, diving into the world of web development. I am positioning myself as a backend developer but also have frontend skills.

Glad to share my projects here!

 
#### [User Management](https://github.com/olozovyk/user-management) - NestJS, REST API, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
  
A REST API service handles user management, authentication and authorization (with roles). It was created using NestJS. PostgreSQL is used for a data storage through TypeORM. Interaction with AWS S3 for storing user avatars has been implemented. The service also includes the [Swagger](https://ec2-52-58-90-89.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/um/api/docs) documentation and unit tests, as well as end-to-end tests.
